    “Freedom is Not Something You Buy, It’s Something You Earn.” -Grant Cardone


    I am fortunate enough to live in a beautiful place in Southwest Florida that
    was voted one of the happiest places in the United States. When the
    opportunity to become a real estate agent presented itself, it just seemed
    like a natural fit.


    Today, after 24 years and 2,100 sales, I want to continue selling but also
    to give back by helping agents grow their business. I have changed markets
    several times and understand there is a formula to growing a real estate
    business that has given me the freedom to live anywhere in the United States
    I choose.


    Honestly, I have never worried about money or where my next deal is coming
    from. When you have a system and a skill set no matter what kind of market
    you are in, there is opportunity to rise above the competition.


    I could tell you about all my awards and accomplishments- but that was
    yesterday. I would rather talk about the future.
