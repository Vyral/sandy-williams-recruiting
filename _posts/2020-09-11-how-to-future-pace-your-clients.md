Someone posted the following in one of my Facebook groups: “My client gets mad at me if I don’t answer their phone call at six in the morning or midnight. What am I supposed to do?” It reminded me of the importance of setting boundaries. How, exactly, do you do that with a brand-new client, though?&nbsp;

As a veteran of the real estate business, I’ve found that you **set boundaries by doing something known as ‘future pacing.’** Set the pace of your business relationship upfront with equal parts tact and honesty.&nbsp;

For example, you could say something to the effect of, “Mrs. Seller, I’m sure you’re very excited about selling your home; may I explain to you how I work? If you call me before 7 a.m. or after work hours beyond 7 p.m., chances are you’ll get my voicemail. However, you can rest assured that I will return your call the following day.”&nbsp;

**Oftentimes, I’ll ask them how*****they *****prefer to communicate;** everyone has a method that works best for them. Ask these sorts of questions in the beginning and future pace your client so that both your expectations are the same. Ultimately, future pacing ensures a smoother transaction for everyone involved.&nbsp;

If you have any further questions about managing expectations or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I’m always here to help and look forward to speaking with you more in depth. Until then, good luck, and let’s keep selling\!&nbsp;
