Dear clients, friends, and colleagues –&nbsp;

We are reaching out to you since we are friends or family, you’ve reached out to us about real estate, you’ve bought or sold a home in the past with our team, or we’ve had a conversation at one time.

As we head into the spring, even with the coronavirus, homes are still being bought and sold and banks are still lending money. However, we write to you today not to let you know about what’s going on in real estate, but rather to let you know that if you or someone you know is looking for a better career, our team is hiring.

I am not sure if you can help me, I’m reaching out today to pick your brain and ask if you know anyone that may be interested in a real estate career.I am hiring just a select few to help me grow my real estate business.

I have generated more leads than I personally can handle.You do not need to have a real estate license to apply.

If you know anyone who might enjoy working in the real estate industry with the opportunity to work in a high tech environment, would you please reply or forward this blog post on to them?

Feel free to forward this blog post to anyone you think who would be interested in the opportunity, too. I will personally reach out to them and invite them to one of my upcoming virtual events. We'll be hosting these about once a month where you'll receive insight on what it takes to have a successful real estate career.
